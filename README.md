# BlueStarling

The niche of Social Media Marketing is riddled with poorly written softwares and eye-soaring marketing gimmicks. BlueStarling is an experiment to explore the niche and bring some intelligence into it.

Python has been chosen as the development language since its really less verbose and helps the core logic to stand out than the syntax.

The focus of the project is:
- Explore Twitter API (both REST and Streaming) for public tweet consumption.
- Evaluate different heuristics for creating an automated twitter account.
- Strategize different techniques for generating more followers without manual intervention.

The scope of this project is limited to building different backend modules only.
