The niche of Social Media Marketing is riddled with poorly written softwares and eye-soaring marketing gimmicks. Twitter is no exception. BlueStarling is an experiment to explore the niche and bring some intelligence into it.

`Python` has been chosen as the development language since its really less verbose and helps the core logic to stand out than the syntax.

The focus of the project is:
- Explore Twitter API (both REST and Streaming) for public tweet consumption.
- Evaluate different heuristics for creating an automated twitter account.
- Strategize different techniques for generating more followers without manual intervention.

The scope of this project is limited to building different backend modules only.
